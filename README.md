# Data Science and AI Engineering Project

## [Customer Segmentation with K-Means](https://github.com/adhkaraa/Customer-segmentation-with-KMeans)  
This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic features. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups to support more effective marketing strategies.

## [Sentiment Analysis of Google Maps Reviews](https://github.com/adhkaraa/Analysis-sentiment-Google-Maps-Review)  
This project analyzes and visualizes user reviews of international airport in Balikpapan collected from Google Maps. The goal is to classify public sentiment and uncover key insights into passenger perceptions and experiences at the airport.

## [Spatial Regression Modelling](https://github.com/adhkaraa/Spatial-regression)  
This project aims to analyze the spatial patterns of the Human Development Index (HDI) in Kalimantan, Indonesia, using spatial regression models.

## [Cholesterol Analysis and Modelling](https://github.com/adhkaraa/cholesterol-analysis-and-modelling)  
This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify which health factors most influence total cholesterol levels. 

## [Forecasting Global CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/adhkaraa/forecasting-co2-emision)  
This project predicts global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes using time series methods (ARIMA, DES, Trend Projection).

## [Image Classification with CNN TensorFlow](https://github.com/adhkaraa/Image-classification-with-CNN-TensorFlow)  
This project builds a binary image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.  

## [Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/adhkaraa/comparative_crop_yield_models)
This project explores various machine learning models to predict crop yield using simulated agricultural field data. By comparing Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, aim to identify the most accurate and interpretable model to support agricultural decision-making and yield optimization.
